            <h1>Subnautica</h1>
            <p>Minecraft is a survival based game where you can craft, mine, build. Survival is key, where you find resources to not starve and defend yourself from MOBS.
                <br>
                Get crafty and use the surrounding environment to gather building materials. See how breaking down trees can help you create something new.
                <br>
                It's always best to avoid the unpredictable by distancing yourself from wandering mobs. You never know what'll happen if they get too close!
                <br>
                Discover all the versatile ways dust from the Redstone ore can be used to enhance your creations, bring them to life, or give them some bang.
